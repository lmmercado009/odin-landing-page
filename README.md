TOP Assignment to build basic website landing page using HTML and CSS

The Odin Project Foundations Landing Page Project

Objective: Build and style a non-responsive website landing page using HTML and CSS while
           solidifying the skills below:

-Efficient workflow for moving between HTML and CSS sides of a webpage
-Strong discipline for committing early and often while building a new web page
-Using previous concepts and lessons learned to guide thoughtful online queries (good
 Googling) in order to learn how to accomplish new tasks or even refresh existing knowledge
-Starting a new webpage from a blank .html file with confidence

Outcome: Successfully built the boilerplate non-responsive website landing page the
         assignment called for, then updated the page contents to be more personal.

-Solidified my understanding of flexbox, especially the differences between
 justify-content, align-content, and align-items.
-Gained a greater comfort level and familiarity with searching for CSS concepts and
 how-to's that are new to me as well as quickly searching for and refreshing myself
 on topics I learned previously.
-Practiced downloading my own images, moving, renaming, etc. in order to add to a website
-Gained confidence and my own sense of style and layout while rearranging my webpage
 without any strictly defined parameters.
-Once the page structure was complete, reworked the template page to now be a landing
 page about my five pets, with real pictures of all of them.
